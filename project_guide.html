                    <h3>What is a Task Manager project?</h3>
                    <p>
                    There is no one-size fits all approach to structuring a project in Task Manager. However, it may be helpful to recognize that
                    Task Manager projects are not intended to be bespoke or unique to a single outcome. Rather, they capture ongoing efforts. With
                    that in mind, here are a few approaches you may want to consider when thinking about how to structure your project in
                    Task Manager:
                    
                    By team - Team-based projects are another common organizational model. This allows your work to mirror your social
                    organization and is convenient in less cross-functional setups, as it allows for more straight forward project
                    permission management.
                    By business unit - You may want to organize around larger business units such as marketing, IT, etc. Types of work will
                    likely fall into similar patterns, making setting up workflows - and issue types particularly - more convenient.
                    By product - If you're a software development team looking to make heavy use of the Task Manager release and versioning system,
                    you'll want to give strong consideration to organizing your projects by releasable product or groups of work that share
                    a common release cycle.
                    Even within these categories, you can get as granular or as broad as you want. For example, if you structure by product,
                    you can continue to sub-categorize by specific features.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>What is a Task Manager board?</h3>
                    <p>
                    If agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development, then an agile board is a tool that
                    helps teams plan, visualize, and manage that work. In Jira, the board displays a selection of work items in columns,
                    with each column representing a step in your team’s workflow for taking work through completion. A board accompanies
                    each Task Manager project by default and provides the team with a shared view of all work that hasn't started, work that is in
                    progress, and work that is completed.
                    
                    Your board can be found in the sidebar navigation under “Board”.</p>

                <div id="issues" class="content-box">
                    <h1>Task Manager work items overview</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What is a work item?</h3>
                    <p>
                    In Task Manager, teams use work items (formerly known as issues) to track bugs and individual pieces of work that must be
                    completed. Depending on how your team uses Jira, a work item could represent a project task, a helpdesk ticket, a leave
                    request form, etc. In Task Manager, work items typically represent individual work items such as big features, user
                    requirements, and software bugs. You can update work items to show work progress or add relevant information such as who
                    is assigned to the work, in-depth description, or attachments.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="workflow" class="content-box">
                    <h1>Task Manager workflows overview</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What is a Task Manager workflow?</h3>
                    <p>
                    In Task Manager, the path your work items take from creation to completion is called workflow. Each workflow is composed of a
                    set of statuses and transitions that your work item moves through during its lifecycle and typically represents work
                    processes within your organization.
                    
                    A Task Manager workflow represents the process your team uses to take a work item from creation to completion. The illustration
                    below is an example workflow:
                        </p>

                <div id="integration" class="content-box">
                    <h1>Integrations with Task Manager overview
                    </h1>
                    <h3>What is a Task Manager app?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    In Task Manager, an app (sometimes called an add-on or plugin) is an installable component that supplements or enhances the
                    functionality of your instance. You and your teams can spend less time managing work and more time building great
                    software with over 3,000 Jira apps that can be custom-tailored to fit any and every use case. On average, software
                    developers check 3.3 tools simply to discover the status of a project, while Jira customers rely on fewer tools (2.3
                    tools), saving valuable time, andincreasing productivity.</p>
